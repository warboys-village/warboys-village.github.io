# Get Involved

If you're interested in getting involved with the PTFA, the easiest way is to simply attend one of our meetings! We welcome all parents, carers, and members of the school community. Meetings are a great way to find out what we're working on, share your ideas, and see how you can contribute. Check our events page for upcoming meeting dates.

If you'd like to know more, get in contact with us either through the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/warboysptfa), or [email](mailto:warboys.chair.ptfa@gmail.com).
