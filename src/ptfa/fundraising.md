# Support the Warboys Academy PTFA

There are a few ways you can help support us, without much effort, during your day-to-day life.

## Recycling

* **Clothing Bank** - We have a clothing bank in the school carpark.

  Items allowed: Shoes (in pairs, please bag/tie them together), adults & childrens clothes (clean and dry), 
  belts & handbags, towels, sheets & bedding, curtains.

  **Please no duvets, pillows, or other bulky items.**

  Note: Please try to bring clothes in carrier-bag size bags (with the handles tied) rather than large bin liners. The chute on the clothing bank can get clogged if bags which are too large are forced in.
* **Ink cartridges** - Next to the clothing bank there is a post with a black metal collection box for ink cartridges.

  **We cannot accept toner cartridges, sorry**

  To see if your ink cartridges are accepted, please check <a href="https://www.recycle4charity.co.uk/InkjetCartridges">this list</a>.
